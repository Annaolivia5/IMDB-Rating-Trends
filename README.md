Purpose: To uncover patterns in the top 1000 rated IMDB movies and TV shows, and to see if there are certain characteristics that will increase chances of being in the top 1000 IMDB titles list.

To answer our questions, we used data accumulated from IMDB’s top 1000 titles.

Disclaimer: Our population consists of only the top 1000 rated titles on IMDB, and does not represent all titles in IMDB. Additionally, our data is not uniformly distributed, since titles with IMDB rating lower than 7.6 were not included in the data. Therefore, assumptions made in our analysis only apply to titles with higher overall viewer sentiment.

Difficulties: 
Limited data - Only looked at IMDB top 1000, could have compared top 1000 to a random sample of non top 1000 titles. 

Time constraint - When we began looking at the data, we weren’t entirely sure what inferences and conclusions could be made. Most of our time was spent exploring what the data was capable of. Towards the end of the project, we began to realize there were many other more meaningful  questions to ask and different ways to analyze the data, but we did not have time to implement those analyses. 

We realized that our question about A vs. UA certificates did not answer our question. If we had taken a random sample of movies and compared the certificates of those movies with the ones on the top 1000, we would have had a better idea of which certificates are likely to increase chance of being on the top 1000 list.
